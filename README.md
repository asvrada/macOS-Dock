# macOS Dock Remake - Focus on animation only

This project remakes the macOS Dock using React, Redux and Tailwind CSS.

It doesn't mimic any actual function of the Dock, like launch apps. This project focuses on the interaction/animation of the Dock, specifically the "magnification" effect when hovering over an app icon.

Again, this is a toy project, it has no actual use or functionality.

## Setup Project

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Build

`npm run build`

## Live Development Env

`npm run dev`

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
